Enemies

1. Create a CUBE object
	- rename the objects as “enemy”
	- reset it values to appear it on the centre

2. Assign material object on the enemy
	- duplicate existing material “DeathZone”
	- rename the material object for enemy object
	- change the albedo , switch to orange albedo
	- apply the material now to the cube

3.  Attach script component to the enemy object	
	- add script “Chaser”
	- speed change to 4
	- distrance to 0
	- assign the the jolen object as its target
	- distance the object from jolen object
	- add a rigidbody physics

4.  Add material on the Box Collider
	- select bouncy material 


5. Add Damage and Health Script script on the enemy
	- apply damage script component on the enemy
	- check the damage on collision, uncheck the others if there are any.
	- apply health script

6. Create a prefab object of the enemy by dragging the object on the Project files
	- add additional enemies on the scene.



Particles and Sound Effects

7. Create->Effects->Particle System
	- rename as explode effect
	- uncheck loop
	-duration change to 1
	- start lifetime to 1
	- gravity 0.5 
	- rate over time to 0
	- burst count is 20
	- shape change to hemisphere
	- size over lifetime change the graph mode
	- render mode change to mesh
		-mesh value is RollerBall
		- change the material as well to RollerBall Material

8. Add a sound effect on the particle system
	- Add audio  source component
	- select PlayerExplosion clip

9. Add component script
	- add component script->Time Object Destructor
		- time out is 3 seconds


10. Make a prefab of the particle system

11. Delete the game object effect particle on the Hierarchy view


12. Apply prefab effect particle system on the Jolen object
	- Under Health script config assign the prefab on the explosion.
	

13. Apply particle system on the coin object.
	- Duplicate the particle effects prefab and name it as Explode Coin Effect
		-start size is 0.2
		-burst count is 10
		- mesh value is the Coin mesh
		- change to Coin material
		- Audio source coin explosion
		- Assign the prefab to any one of the Coin object on the Explosion Prefab and Click Apply
		 to apply effect to all coin object

		
14. Apply the same principle on the Enemy object



Animation

15. Select the DeathZone game object
	- Open Window->Animation
	- Create -> Save as DeathZone Animation
	- Drag the animation tab window to Game Scene View Tab
	- Create animation by clicking the record button and changing the albedo color
	 	- Time frame from 0.0 -> 0.10. 0.20.0.40
